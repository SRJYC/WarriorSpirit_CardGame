  - 'POWER isn''t like ATK. It''s rather an evaluation than a strength. Not all abilities
    can benefits from POWER. '
  - 'DURABILITY is like hitpoint. When it reaches 0, unit is destroyed. There''s no
    maximum value. '
  - Player need to pay COST to summon Spirit. It's not a big restriction. The real
    matter is what you have on board.
  - SPEED determines the order of Spirit to take action.
  - 
  - 
  - Spirit with BREAKER can deal more damage to Spirit.

  - 
  - DUR becomes negative, so common damage effect only makes it more durable. You
    need to gain its DUR until it reaches 0.
  - Spirit with SHIELD will take less damage.
