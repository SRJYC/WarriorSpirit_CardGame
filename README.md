## This is a card game project demo by one developer.

My idea is that cards are limited in deck, but unlimited in Game. When build the deck, player has a few choices. They can only add 6 cards from all the Rank 1 cards. But in the game, player can Rank Up units. Cards can developed into different High Rank Cards by combining with other cards. 

This is very flexible. Player can choose different tactics based on situation, so they aren't determining before game actual start but in game. So player can avoid things like [No key cards], [Have worse deck], and [Have useless cards]

However, this is just Demo version. Features are not completed. This is minimum viable play only. 

The game is built with Unity (Version 2019.1.10) . The platform is Unity PC, Mac, Linux standalone. 

Currently, there's only 20 cards and simple AI. My simple and crude vector drawing. Background, sound effect, and particle effects are free asset from Unity Asset Store.

Since, I am Chinese, this game support Simplify Chinese as well.
